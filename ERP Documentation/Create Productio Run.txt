1 - GetProductRouting
1.1 - get from WorkEffortGoodStandards the last valid 
    record that represets 'Production Run and Product to Deliver Association'
1.2 - get the workeffort record for the routing
1.3 - get thhe routing tasks - components - from WorkEffortAssocs
    , also representing the last valid set
    
2. GetManufacturingComponents
2.1 - get last valid BOM record  from ProductAssocs
2.2 - another call to GetProductRouting
2.3 - Finalize BOM by multiplying the quantity of each component
    by the quantity of the product to be manufactured
    
3 - create the workeffort record for the header production run
    , the dynamic record.
    
4 - create the dynamic record for the product to be created
    , in WorkEffortGoodStandards
    
5 - Loop in Tasks RoutingTasksAssocs, from GetProductRouting
5.1 GetEstimatedTaskTime
5.1.1 get the estimated time for the task from the related routing task record; 
    the WorkEffort record for the task; this includes
    the setup time, the run time
    
5.2 determine the end date for the task using AddForward
    and any configured calendar data
    
5,3 -  create the workeffort record for the task, a dynamic one
5,4 - create a dynamic record for the task in WorkEffortAssoc
5.5 - CloneWorkEffortPartyAssignments
5.6 = CloneWorkEffortCostCalcs
5.6.1 - using the master routingTaskId for the task, get the last 
    valid record from WorkEffortCostCalcs
5.6.2 - for each cost calc record, create a new dynamic record in
    workeffort cost calcs table, using the new workeffortId
    
5.7 - Loop in the BOM components and create the workeffortGoodStandard
    records for each component, and attach to the first task
    
6 - Update the main workeffort record with the last task end date
